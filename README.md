Do you love driving tanks with hand-cranked turrets, but hate mashing arrow keys? Well, *mash no more*! It's **MouseCrank**, a free utility that generates arrow presses from mouse input to drive manually-traversed turrets.

## Features

* Toggle on and off with a configurable keybind
* Runs in the background, minimizes to tray, and sleeps when not in use for next-to-zero performance impact
* User-configurable sensitivity and curve settings, saved between sessions
* Sounds to indicate toggle state
* Sends keys exclusively to the Steel Beasts application â€” no errant key presses!
* DPI-aware
* Free and open source!
